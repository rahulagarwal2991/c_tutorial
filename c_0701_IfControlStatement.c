    Relational operators:

    ==
    !=
    <
    >
    <=
    >=

    x==y    this is for equality which means both values x and y should be equal,
            if equal we will get true   
    x!=y    ! -> not operator , != not equal , if both the values are not equal we
            will get true  

    x<y    < less than , if LHS value is smaller than RHS value , true
    x>y    > greater than , if LHS value is greater than RHS then it gives true.
    x<=y   <= less than equal to , LHS value should be smaller or equal to RHS value
    x>=y   >= greater than equal to , LHS value should be greater than or equal to RHS value
